<P>Jana Gana Mana  is the national anthem of India. It is composed in Bengali by poet Rabindranath Tagore. The composition consisting of the words and music of the first stanza of the late poet Rabindra Nath Tagore’s song known as “Jana Gana Mana” is the National Anthem of India.</P>
<P>
The first stanza of the song Bharata Bhagya Bidhata was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950. A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately fifty-two seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20 seconds to play) is also staged occasionally. It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now, Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress. This is the first of five stanzas of Tagore's Bengali song Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata.

<P>The poem is written in a literary register of the Bengali language called sadhu bhasa. The song has been written almost entirely using nouns that also can function as verbs. Most of the nouns of the song are in use in all major languages in India. Therefore, the original song is quite clearly understandable, and in fact, remains almost unchanged in several widely different Indian languages. The transcription below reflects the Bengali pronunciation, in both the Bengali script and romanisation.

Jana Gana Mana was sung on 27 December 1911 at the Indian National Congress, Calcutta and again in January 1912 at the annual event of the Adi Brahmo Samaj. Though the Bengali song had been written in 1911, it was largely unknown except to the readers of the Adi Brahmo Samaj journal, Tattwabodhini Patrika, of which Tagore was the editor.<P>

Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people,<br>
Dispenser of India's destiny.<br>
Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sindh,<br>
Gujarat and Maratha,<br>
Of the Dravida and Odisha and Bengal;<br>
It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas,<br>
mingles in the music of Yamuna and Ganges and is<br>
chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea.<br>
They pray for thy blessings and sing Thy praise<br>.
The saving of all people waits in thy hand,<br>
Thou dispenser of India's destiny.<br>
Victory, Victory, Victory to Thee.<br>
